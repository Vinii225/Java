## 📝 Exercise Lists in Portuguese

This repository includes official **PDF exercise lists** provided during the course (in **Brazilian Portuguese**).  
Each list includes exercise descriptions, and for each one, I provide a Java implementation and explanatory comments — all in English.
These lists are organized by sections and can be found in the `exercises` folder.

These PDFs serve as helpful references and documentation of my progress.
